# intro_comp_neuro
This repo contains python notebooks covering the tutorials in An Introductory Course in Computational Neuroscience (Paul Miller, 2018).
Tutorials in the textbook are originally in MATLAB (see https://github.com/jlindbloom/EE-5341---Computational-Neuroscience for completed
MATLAB scripts), but I'm completing them in python. 
Notebooks are (probably) numbered according to tutorial assignments in the book.
